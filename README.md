### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer** with 8 years of experience delivering end-to-end solutions across web platforms, SaaS products, enterprise systems, and microservices architectures. My work spans **system design, performance optimization, application architecture, product development, and backend engineering** — not just refactoring or maintenance.

I build scalable and secure applications, modernize legacy systems when needed, and ship production-ready features using **PHP, Node.js, and Python**, while collaborating closely with teams to turn business goals into working software.
